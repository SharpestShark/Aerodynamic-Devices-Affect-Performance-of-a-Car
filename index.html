    <div id="explanation1">
      The affects of Aerodynamic Devices on a Car's Performance. These 'devices' include spoilers, splitters and other wings.

      <h2>Controlled Drag</h2>
      <div id="p2">
      Induced drag occurs when a lift or downforce causes drag. It is a common source of drag on a race car. It is a high-payoff modification to focus on reducing it. At the same time, downforce can make the car faster. This calls for a compromise.

      <h2>Keep the Balance</h2>
      <div id="p2">
        Without getting too technical, the aerodynamic downforce on the axles affects the balance of the car. As the car goes faster, this aerodynamic force affects its ability to take high-speed corners.<br>
        Downforce improvement should be done to both the rear and front of the vehicle to balance out the changes. If the ratio is even, the force will be even. If it is not even, you might find it harder to manage the vehicle at high speeds.
